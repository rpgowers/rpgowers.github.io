I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical neuroscience at the Humboldt University of Berlin in the [Computational Neurophysiology Group](https://www.neuron-science.de/). My research focuses on modelling how neuronal structure affects the ability of neurons to synchronise their network activity.

I obtained my PhD in Mathematics of Real-World systems, _Fluctuation-driven firing in spatially extended neuron models_, at the University of Warwick and was supervised by Magnus Richardson and Yulia Timofeeva. My PhD thesis can be found [here](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/148007/).
