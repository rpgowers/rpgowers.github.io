Neurons come in a variety of different shapes and sizes, with their dendritic arbours differing not just between different neuron classes but also between neurons belonging to the same class. It is known that the spike generation process of neurons can differ, with this process being termed the excitability type. The spike timing response to external stimuli of neurons with different excitability types differs, meaning that arranging neurons of one excitability type into a mutually connected network can yield spiking synchrony, whilst a different excitability type does not produce a synchronous state.

This project seeks to discover how the extent of a neuron's dendritic arbour affects network activity states via switches in the excitiability type of the constitutent neurons.

Our current results can be found in the preprint: [Dendritic morphology affects the neuronal excitability type and the network state

Increasing the size of the dendritic arbour increases the input conductance, which switches the excitability type from SNIC to HOM.  The SNIC excitability type has a symmetric phase-response curve (PRC), which does not confer a particular synchronisation state to a network of all-to-all coupled inhibitory neurons.  In contrast, the HOM excitability type grants an asymmetric PRC, which causes global in-phase synchrony to be a stable network state.
